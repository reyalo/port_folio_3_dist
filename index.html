    <meta name="description" content="Competitive Programmer | Embedded Systems Engineer | Processor Designer

As a dedicated competitive programmer, I thrive on tackling complex algorithmic challenges and optimizing systems for maximum performance. My deep understanding of data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving equips me to handle high-pressure situations, both in coding competitions and real-world projects.

In addition to competitive programming, I bring expertise in embedded systems and IoT, where I've worked extensively with platforms like Arduino and ESP32 to develop innovative solutions. My hands-on experience extends to designing an ARM-based 32-bit processor using Verilog, highlighting my strong foundation in computer architecture and hardware design.

My knowledge of both hardware and software allows me to bridge the gap between low-level system design and high-level programming, making me a versatile engineer. Whether it’s creating scalable, optimized embedded systems or competing in high-level programming contests, I am driven by a passion for excellence and innovation." />
